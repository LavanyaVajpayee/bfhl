# BFHL API

This is the **BFHL API** built with **Node.js + Express** for the VIT Full Stack assignment.

The API exposes a single endpoint:


It processes an input array and returns:
- Even numbers (as strings)
- Odd numbers (as strings)
- Alphabets (in UPPERCASE)
- Special characters
- The sum of all numbers (as a string)
- A `concat_string` built from all letters, reversed with alternating caps  
- User details (`user_id`, `email`, `roll_number`)
